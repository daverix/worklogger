Worklogger
==========

An eco system on Android for storing working hours. A plugin architecture is worked upon that will let apps with specific permissions to toggle entering and exiting work. A content provider is exposed for data access and some utility services exists in the main app.

This project started with looking at the work place's wifi but it seems the phone is disconnected while going into sleep mode. The plugin architecture will make it possible to try out different approaches for logging work.
